### Software Engineer at A.R. Merkeleon

I worked with Nikita in one project team developing a web application for large FMCG manufacturer for about two years
and went together trought different challenges at different project stages. Nikita as highly qualified fullstack
web-developer was always able to contribute a lot knowledge and experience There is couple of things I specifically
liked about working with Nikita.

While planning a product architecture Nikita was always focused on final results, sometimes he was able to stop our
emotional starship crafting discussions, bring us back to earth and make us stay focused on what we really need to
deliver.

NIkita is real team players. After deciding togther on what we need to do and how we want to have it done (in terms of
solution architecture), we were always able to decompose and distribute projects tasks based on ones experience,
knowledge and preferences. After the plan is agreed you can be rock solid sure - Nikita's part is delivered. If you need
help or want to discuss some complex issue to have a fresh look - feel free to contact Nikita, you will always have his
support and valueble input.

Besides deleivering solid results in terms of features and deadlines Nikita always paid attention to the quality of the
arcitecture and code we crafted Reviewing Nikita's code has always been pleasure.

We did not just deliver code toghether. Our small team managed to have a good time and lot of fun, we discussed so many
things, well mostly related to programming... Having a teammate (Nikita) who is not just professional but a nice person
to deal with really makes the team more attractive place to work. Still miss this days )

Strongly endorse Nikita. You are lucky if you have a chance to have him in your team.

### Head Of Web Development at "Architectural Bureau" LLC

I met Nikita during the advanced training courses, where I acted as a teacher, and Nikita was a student. During the
courses, Nikita showed zeal in doing his homework, and some of his decisions made me think that Nikita should be the
teacher in these courses, not me)
